# Weather app

## Link
https://dpmon-weather-app.herokuapp.com/

## Usage
Input the location in the textbox and click Search. It will then display the weather data.

- Keep in mind that there may be multiple locations with the same name.  You can find a specific location by adding more data like the state or country.
- It will automatically bypass minor spelling mistakes.

## About
I use Heroku to host the app.
I use Mapbox and Dasksky API in this app.

I created this during a course I did on Coursera on Javascript (course by Andrew Mead).
